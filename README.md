WasteWise – Mobile Application (Frontend)
Description

The WasteWise mobile application serves as the monitoring interface for the WasteWise smart garbage bin system. It allows maintenance staff and administrators to view the real-time status of garbage bins, including whether a bin is Not Full or Full. The app receives periodic updates from the backend server, which collects data from the IoT devices deployed around the campus.

The mobile app focuses on providing a simple, clear, and accessible way to monitor bin status to improve waste collection efficiency and reduce overflow incidents.
